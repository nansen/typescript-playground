    *Plugin for Sublime - https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin

About environment:
- The project is limited as much as possible to TypeScript, so no grunts, gulps or any kind of bundling or less or any other funny stuff like that
- AMD had to be used to get everything compiled into a single file by the typescript compiler
- Added JQuery and it's typings just as an example
- You need to run a standard npm install
- If your IDE complains about an older version of TypeScript, update it, should be 2.1.6
- The typescript project is in the ts/ folder
- To compile TypeScript run "npm run ts:build" in cmd/terminal
- To enable watch of TypeScript run "npm run ts:watch" in cmd/terminal
- To run the node server "npm start" (the server runs on https://localhost:40001)
- To kill node server close the cmd/terminal window or use whatever your OS supports as the terminate command (Ctrl+c on Windows)
